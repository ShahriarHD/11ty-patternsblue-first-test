This works really well with CSS layout mechanisms like CSS Grid and Flexbox as well. Consider a list with children that you want to maintain a 1:1 aspect ratio, such as a grid of sponsor icons:

```html
<ul class="sponsor-grid">
    <li class="sponsor">
        <img src="..." alt="..." />
    </li>
    <li class="sponsor">
        <img src="..." alt="..." />
    </li>
</ul>
```
